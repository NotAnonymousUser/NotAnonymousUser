I'm a passionate and driven software developer with a year of experience in both frontend and backend development. After completing my Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from DUET Karachi, I transitioned into the IT field because it was my passion.

My experience includes working with SAP Business One, Crystal Reports, SAP DTW, and SQL Server Management Studio. Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge by learning the following skills in the Governor Sindh IT & AI Initiative program- Certified Cloud Applied Generative AI Engineer (GenEng) .

Currently upskilling in Generative AI through the Governor Sindh IT program:

Mastering TypeScript & Python programming
Deep-diving into front-end development with React & Next.js
Exploring API development, databases, containers, and cloud deployment
Gaining practical experience through project-based learning

I'm eager to leverage my diverse skillset and contribute to innovative projects within the software development industry. I'm open to new opportunities and excited to connect with like-minded professionals.
